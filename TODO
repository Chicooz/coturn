==================================================================

###   I. PLATFORMS SUPPORT   ###

==================================================================

1) Fedora official package (turnserver or coturn ? TBD).

2) MS Windows support.

	Cygwin is supported. A "real" MS-Windows port would 
	involve a usable GUI.

==================================================================

###   II. DOCS   ###

==================================================================

1) User's manual.

2) Developer's manual.

==================================================================

###   III. NETWORK ENGINE   ###

==================================================================

1) Kernel module for data channels.

==================================================================

###   IV. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION   ###

==================================================================

1) A smarter load balancer has to be implemented.

	The load balancer has to have a heartbeat channels with 
	the slave servers, currently it is only just a dumb 
	round-robin load distributor.

==================================================================

###   V. SECURITY   ###

==================================================================

1) RADIUS integration ?

==================================================================

###   VI. STANDARDS SUPPORT   ###

==================================================================

1) Follow the draft ICE endpoint mobility standard and apply changes 
when necessary:

   https://ietf.org/doc/draft-wing-mmusic-ice-mobility/

2) For extra difficult NAT/FWs, consider implementing Websockets.

3) MS TURN, MS STUN extensions.

4) Multiple origins.

5) ALPN with TLS and DTLS (when OpenSSL 1.0.2 is available).

6) Redirect draft.

7) Dual allocation draft.

8) New security oAuth draft.

9) DTLS 1.2 (when available).

==================================================================

###   VII. MISC FEATURES   ###

==================================================================

1) Locale support (?).

	Currently we assume that all text data is 8-bits ASCII 
	encoded, like C locale. It would be nice to support localized
	strings (both 8-bits and 2-bytes). But I am not sure 
	whether this is really important, given the essentially
	backend nature of the TURN Server. The TURN server is so 
	deeply "hidden" in the network infrastructure that the 
	significant code complication may be unjustified.

2) HTTP or GUI status monitor and management.

	For enterprise users, a management (configuration, status 
	and statistics) GUI has to be implemented. Currently, all 
	these features are available through the shell command 
	line, telnet client and through Redis command line.

3) Traffic recording (for selected allocations).

	That would be a helpful feature for a large enterprise 
	(for testing and security purposes). 

4) Ganglia monitoring.

###   VIII. CODING STUFF   ###
